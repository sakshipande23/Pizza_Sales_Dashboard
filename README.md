# Problem Statement 
We need to analyze critical indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into the business performance. Precisely, calculate the following metrics:
1. Total Revenue - The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
2. Average Order Value - The average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of order
3. Total pizza sold - The sum of the quantities sold.
4. Average pizza per order - The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the number of orders
